Welcome to bamazon, when the app is started a question is asked to whether you want to view inventory or not.  Yes will take you to the inventory, no will end the connection.  The inventory screen will show you the items we have for sale, followed by the price of each item.  When asked for the ID of the product, this is the first set of number(s) before the product name, which indicates which product it is.  The following question is how many you want to purchase, if you order more than what we have in inventory, you will recieve an error and will be shown our inventory again, so you can try again with another amount.  If we do have the correct amount the order will be placed and it will give you the total you will be charged.  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LA2gFbGDl70Px6_CIguS350oKpfkp0ID
